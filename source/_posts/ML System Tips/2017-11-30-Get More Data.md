# Get More Data

## 1. Why We Need More Data?

In many situations (low bias learning model), more data usually means better performance of the model.

## 2. When We Need More Data?

Usually, we should plot the learning curve by using part of the training data (1/10). If we have low bias curve, then we are safely increase the training data to get better machine learning model.

## 3. How to Get More Data?

- Artificial data synthesis (e.g., rotation, crop, change background, etc)
- Collect and label the data manually
- Hire other company to label (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk)

Usually to make the original data 10 times larger won't take so much effort, but it will make the performance of the model much better.
